## About Gemini Ai

The fastest way to start using Gemini is with Google AI Studio, a web-based tool that lets you prototype and run prompts right in your browser. you can visit the following [link](https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview)

as we know Gemini can process Text to Text and Image to Text, but to do that Gemini provides two different models:
Text to Text - use gemini-pro
Image to Text - use gemini-pro-vision

## How to use

- clone
- cd go to the cloned file
- npm i node dotenv @google/generative-ai
- Text to Text running gemini-pro `node gemini-pro.js` and write you want
- Image to Text running gemini-pro-vision `node gemini-pro-vision.js`
